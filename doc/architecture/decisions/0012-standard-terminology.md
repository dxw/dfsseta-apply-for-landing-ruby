# ADR 0012: Standard terminology for the Apply for Landing service

## Context

Names are difficult; the fact that the Apply for Landing service will be
developed in various languages by teams working largely independently of each
other makes them more so. To ensure clarity and lack of ambiguity in
communicating about the service, a set of standard terms is needed.

## Decision

The following list of terms shall be used to refer to core components of the
service unambiguously.

- **Arrival Date** The first day for which a Landing Permit is valid.
- **Departure Date** The final day for which a Landing Permit is valid.
- **Destination** The location for which a Landing Permit is valid. All
  Destinations are Landable Bodies.
- **DfSSETA** Acronym for the Department for Space Strategy and
  Extra-Terrestrial Affairs. Pronounced /diɛfseɪtə/ (roughly 'dee-eff-SAY-ta')
- **Landable Body** An astronomical object upon which it is possible for a
  Spacecraft to land. In practice, this will be a planet or a moon.
- **Landing Duration** The timespan for which a Landing Permit is valid; the
  span between a Landing Permit's Arrival and Departure Dates.
- **Landing Permit** A Permit issued by DfSSETA allowing a Spacecraft to land at
  a Destination and remain there for a specified Duration.
- **Landing Permit Identifer** or **Permit ID** A unique identifier assigned to
  each Landing Permit
- **Maximum Permitted Stay** The greatest possible Landing Duration for which a
  Landing Permit may be issued for a given Destination.
- **Personal Details** Information characterising a Pilot
- **Pilot** A human responsible for the navigation, direction, and safe handling
  of a Spacecraft.
- **Pilot License** A permit authorising a human to act as a Pilot.
- **Pilot License Identifier** or **License ID** A unique identifier assigned to
  each Pilot License
- **Spacecraft** A vehicle capable of transporting a Pilot to a Destination
- **Spacecraft Registration Identifier** or **Registration ID** A unique
  identifier assigned to each Spacecraft
